# Uchechi  - Data Analyst Journey

### About 
Hi, I'm Uchechi! I have a solid background in software functional testing and fraud prevention, with a deep passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. Currently, I am focused on a journey to re-mastering SQL and learning Tableau.

Over the years, I have built a strong foundation in compliance and fraud prevention, driven by a commitment to leveraging data for informed decision-making. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.

- ðŸ‘€Diving into dashboards and uncovering insights is something I genuinely enjoy. After years of making decisions based on pre-built dashboards, I decided to take control of the data myself. I embarked on a journey to master data visualization and build my own insights, rather than relying solely on automated systems.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Tableau, and here are a few projects I've been working on so far.
