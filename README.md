# Uchechi  - Data Analyst Journey

### About 
Hi, I'm Uchechi! My background is in software functional testing and fraud prevention. Currently, I am on track to mastering SQL, Tableau and PowerBI data analytic toolkits. I have over the years, developed a strong foundation in compliance and fraud prevention with passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills and my journey, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics.
